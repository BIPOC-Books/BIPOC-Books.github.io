  quotes:
    - page: "I.18"
      content: All warfare is based on deception.
    - page: "III.18"
      content: "Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know
        yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If
        you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained
        you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor
        yourself, you will succumb in every battle."
    - page: "V.15"
      content: Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;
        decision, to the releasing of a trigger.
    - page: "IX.24"
      content: Humble words and increased preparations are signs that
        the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving
        forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.
    - page: "VI.1"
      content: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of
        the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the
        field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.
    - page: "X.31"
      content: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory
        will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you
        may make your victory complete.

      Gödel's incompleteness theorem, Escher's self-referential drawings,
      Bach's self-reference and improvization.

      Contracrostipunctus and Geometry. Bach's final Contrapunctus in
      his Art of Fugue ends with the notes B A C H, which was convention
      in Germany for the notes Bb A C B.
    - "Reference in the annotated bibliography to:
      Gebstadter, Egbert B.,
      *Copper, Silver, Gold: An Indestructible Metallic Alloy.*
      Perth: Acidic Books, 1979.

      '*A formidable hodge-podge, turgid and confused - yet remarkably
      similar to the present work. Professor Gebstadter's Shandean
      digressions include some excellent examples of indirect self-reference.
      Of particular interest is a reference in its well-annotated bibliography
      to an isomorphic, but imaginary, book.*'"
  quotes:
    - page: "17"
      content: But whereas it is very simple to talk about language in
        language, it is not at all easy to see how a statement about
        numbers can talk about itself.

        (Zeno) "Frankly I've only had one Great Idea -
        I just exploit it in different ways.
    - page: "37"
      content: It is an inherent property of intelligence that it can
        jump out of the task which it is performing, and survey what
        it has done; it is always looking for, and always finding, patterns.
    - page: "44"
      content: Such a reader would do wisely in abandoning Euclid,
        and taking to football.
