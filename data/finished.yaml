  notes:
    - "Reference in the annotated bibliography to:
      Holder, Place,
      *Placeholder: A way to present temporary content.*
      Perth: Acidic Books, 1979.

      '*A formidable hodge-podge, turgid and confused - yet remarkably
      similar to the present work. Professor Gebstadter's Shandean
      digressions include some excellent examples of indirect self-reference.
      Of particular interest is a reference in its well-annotated bibliography
      to an isomorphic, but imaginary, book.*'"
  quotes:
    - page: "200"
      content: "Love knows no shame. To be loving is to be open to grief, to be touched by sorrow, even sorrow that is unending."
    - page: "204"
      content: "When we live fully in the present, when we acknowledge 
        that death is always with us and not just there at the moment 
        when we breathe our last breath, we are not devastated by events 
        over which we have no controlâ€”losing a job, rejection by someone 
        we hoped to connect with, the loss of a longtime friend or companion."
